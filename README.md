In this topsy-turvy world, play as against your friends as little shrooms, sprouting your roots, and laying traps to catch your opponent, enjoy the colorful scenes and fast-paced action, but watch out - your world is gonna turn upside down!

You can run, jump and sprout roots. You may also jump on and off your roots and sprout new roots from old ones, however, your opponents roots are dangerous and if you come into contact with them, you will lose health. Every 5 seconds, the whole scene rotates 90 degrees.

Designers notes: the rotation mechanic of the game forces the players to constantly readjust and plan ahead as to where they lay their roots, because you need to plant roots to catch your opponent out and make sure that you do not fall into the roots of your opponent.
